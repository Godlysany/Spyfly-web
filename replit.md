## Recent Changes (Sept 30, 2025)
### Critical Bug Fixes - Post Security Audit Regressions
- ✅ **Fixed API Data Mapping Issues**:
  - Resolved competition data loading failure - table was empty despite database having data
  - Added data transformation layer in server.js to map database columns to frontend expectations
  - Database: `competition_type` → Frontend: `type`
  - Database: `total_prize_pool` → Frontend: `prize_pool`
  - Database: `prize_breakdown` (table) → Frontend: `prize_structure` (JSON object)
  - Fixed GET /api/competitions, POST /api/competitions, and PUT /api/competitions/:id endpoints

- ✅ **Advanced Prize Distribution System**:
  - **Controlled Input UI**: Individual input fields for each prize position (not just JSON textarea)
  - **Live Validation**: Real-time tracking ensures prizes don't exceed total pool amount
  - **Visual Feedback**: 
    - Shows Total Pool, Allocated, and Remaining amounts
    - Progress bar with color coding (green = good, red = over budget)
    - Instant warning when prizes exceed pool
  - **Auto-Calculation Presets**:
    - 🥇 Top 3: 50%, 30%, 20% split
    - 🏆 Top 5: 40%, 25%, 20%, 10%, 5% split
    - 💎 Top 10: Top-heavy distribution (35%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 8%, 5%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 1%)
    - ⚖️ Equal: User-defined equal distribution (prompts for number of positions)
  - **Dynamic Management**: Add/remove prize positions with visual controls
  - **Validation**: Prevents form submission if prizes exceed pool

- ✅ **Fixed Statistics Tab UI Integration**:
  - Fixed $NaN display issue by adding parseFloat() for prize pool calculations
  - Fixed "undefined" competition type by adding fallback to 'unknown'
  - Fixed winners count by using correct database column `payment_status` instead of `status`
  - Added proper error handling and fallback values (0) for all statistics
  - Fixed unique users calculation using wallet address deduplication
  - Added credentials to winners API call for authentication

- ✅ **Fixed Authentication Redirect Loop**:
  - Changed redirects to absolute paths (e.g., '/admin.html' instead of 'admin.html')
  - Used window.location.replace() to prevent back button issues
  - Wrapped checkAuth() in DOMContentLoaded event to ensure cookie is processed before auth check
  - Fixed cookie timing issue that caused infinite redirects between login and admin pages
